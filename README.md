This is a fun educational app for people to explore the relationship between frequency and pitch, and create their own musical scales.

After starting the program, the user will see a black line representing the continuum of frequencies. 
They can click the add notes button to enter note input mode. Then, they can click anywhere on the canvas
to add note dots to the line. The user clicks the button again to exit note input mode. They can click on any of the note dots to play the corresponding frequency. The note dot will turn red as a visual indicator while the note plays.
